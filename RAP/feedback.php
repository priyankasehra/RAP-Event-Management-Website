        <h1>Kind words from our clients</h1>

        <div class="feedback-para">
        <p class="para">“Where do I even begin?! We first started planning with Team RAP about a year before our wedding and let me just say - the BEST decision we made during 
            the entire wedding process was to hire them. RAP walked us through everything and was always so organized and 5 steps ahead. They listened to every 
            comment, question, concern and always got back to me in a timely manner. Even on their days off they would shoot me emails to 
            keep me updated. Communication was never an issue - I always looked forward to their emails and our coffee dates! RAP really makes a big effort to 
            make sure that everything is set well beforehand so that even the week leading up to the wedding is stress-free and it really was. The wedding day 
            was absolutely FLAWLESS thanks to RAP and their team at RAP Event Planning. They were with us from first thing in the morning to the very end 
            of the reception. While getting ready, I realized I didn’t have my veil which was still at the bridal shop and they told me not to worry and was on 
            it right away. I didn’t even stress as I got my veil well before the ceremony even started. They made sure all the vendors were there on time, that 
            everyone was on schedule, that all the bridesmaid/groomsmen and parents dresses/tuxes were all steamed and most importantly that we were all enjoying 
            the day. Throughout the whole day they made sure my husband and I were comfortable, hydrated, had enough food and they were always there to reapply my 
            lipgloss! All our belongings including those of our parent and bridal party were always transported to the right room and right time, I don’t know how 
            they do it! To this day our families and bridal party all rave about what an incredible job RAP and their team did. Guests were even asking us for 
            RAP’s contact info during the wedding because they were so impressed.  Team RAP and I spent a lot of time talking about the vision and design for the 
            wedding and they surpassed all our expectations. Every detail from the flowers, the table setting, escort cards, was so thoughtfully executed that I 
            couldn’t even tell you if anything did go wrong. Most importantly, the whole day was completely stress-free for us, our families, bridal party, so 
            that we could enjoy everything to the fullest. Because of how helpful and amazing Team RAP was leading up to the wedding, we also asked them to help with 
            our rehearsal, rehearsal dinner and brunch which were all executed perfectly. There really aren’t enough words to describe how grateful and lucky my 
            husband and I are to have met Team RAP and for all the hard work they and their wonderful team put into making our wedding weekend the best weekend of our 
            lives. The saddest part about the wedding being over was that we were going to miss working with Team RAP - they wasn’t just our wedding planner, we really 
            built a great friendship and I’ll still email them to go for coffee :) We will definitely be planning more events with them in the future. Thank you 
            Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and RAP Event Planning for making our dream wedding come true!!”</p>

        <p class="para">“Riha, Abhishek and Priyanka are a dream team! The first thing that drew me to them was their warmth, professionalism, and—despite having thrown many beautiful, 
            high-end weddings— their lack of pretension. It’s clear their mission is execute a couple’s dream wedding, not plan weddings that align with their 
            vision/portfolio. They offered up lots of creative ideas, reviewed contracts with a fine-tooth comb (saving us $$ in the process), and were able to 
            transition from being sensitive to tough depending on what the situation called for. I also found that the vendors they know and work with are of the 
            same caliber. I was initially hesitant to hire a wedding planner because of the cost, but looking back at how much they did as well as how much stress 
            they took off our plates, I can’t imagine having planned this wedding on my own. Hiring this team was one of the best decisions we made!”</p>

        <p class="para">“Wow, where do I begin! We worked with RAP for our engagement and then for all our wedding events. They did an amazing job throughout. Our wedding 
            was across the country and RAP planned everything from a distance, which was very impressive. No detail was left unnoticed as well on our special 
            days and even in the planning process- my husband and I were always so impressed how organized, excited and calm that they were. Not only did we have a 
            wonderful experience with RAP but our families loved them as well. It was important for our wedding that our family felt very welcomed and 
            RAP went above and beyond to make sure that happened. Most importantly, my husband and I felt listened to throughout the process, taken care of 
            and that RAP had our best interests at heart. Because they are so awesome they sourced awesome vendors for us (photography, videography, etc) so 
            we have nothing but amazing memories when we look back on our special days. As a bride, you want to make sure that you have good people on your team the 
            day of and during my wedding I was so relaxed and at ease because I knew I was in such good hands with Riha, Abhishek and Priyanka. Hiring RAP was one of 
            the best decisions that we made throughout our planning process and we have no regrets! You won’t either if you decide to hire them.”</p>

        <p class="para">“There’s honestly enough stars to fully articulate how amazing Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and their team are, and how big of an impact they had on making our wedding truly the 
            day of our dreams. We hired Team RAP 6 months before our wedding as a day of/month of coordinator - we planned a full weekend event in the Catskills 
            with a tented wedding reception ( involving renting literally every single thing from several vendors) at a somewhat non-traditional venue and as 
            organized and detail oriented as my husband and I both are, we realized eventually that we were, for a number of reasons in way over our heads . We 
            spoke to a number of wedding planners and knew immediately Team RAP was the one for us - they listened to our points of concern/stress and immediately 
            impressed us with their calm, no nonsense attitude and ability to put us at ease and make us believe that it really was going to work out. Beginning 
            the month of, Team RAP took over what I can only imagine were the literally dozens of emails across several vendors (many of whom were difficult to work 
            with, non responsive, etc.) and made sure that everything was delivered on time and went smoothly, and more so that the stress, and back and forth stayed 
            off our plates so that we could really focus on enjoying our last few days leading up to the big weekend. All that being said - where Team RAP really shines 
            is the day of the wedding. They and what felt like an army of assistants (who were all also amazing) arrived at our venue right as my bridesmaids and I 
            were sitting down for hair and makeup, and from there it was game on - Team RAP was running the show and all my husband and I had to do was relax and 
            enjoy our day. Even little disasters along the way Team RAP handled like it was no big deal - from tracking down a runaway bridesmaid to literally hand-
            sewing my train back to my dress when my bustle broke, to dealing with the million questions that bridesmaids, groomsmen, parents, guests and the venue had 
            at every step along the way that would have otherwise been directed to me. Team RAP ran interference and kept everyone on task and focused on having the 
            most fun possible. I should also mention that Team RAP’s eye for decor and event design really helped bring my vision to life - they were able to 
            seamlessly move ceremony pieces/florals to the reception tent and re purpose in ways that really elevated the space, without adding any additional cost 
            to our bottom line. I could write a novel honestly about how amazing Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and their team were but i’ll leave anyone reading this review with this: 
            there are going to be many, many times throughout your wedding planning process where you ask yourself “do we really need to spend this money?” and of all 
            the things that we spent money on, Team RAP and RAP Event Planning are the one thing we could not have lived without- every thing else at the end 
            of the day is secondary to actually being able to enjoy your wedding and having Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and their team enabled us to have truly the best day of our 
            lives.”</p>

        <p class="para">“Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and their team at RAP Event Planning listened to our vision and then created our dream wedding on the beach in Bardez. The wedding was beautiful-
            complete with sun, sand, palm trees, sailboats in the background, dancing on the beach and fireworks. Everyone had a blast for the entire weekend. Our 
            friends have described it as “epic, magical and a bubble of love.” Team RAP thought of every detail in advance, and they and their team executed to perfection 
            during the wedding. Team RAP is incredibly nice, professional and attentive, and most importantly for anyone thinking of planning a destination wedding, they 
            are very knowledgeable about beach culture and practices. We couldn’t be happier, couldn’t have done it without them and can’t recommend them highly
            enough!”</p>

        <p class="para">“Riha, Abhishek, Priyanka and the rest of the RAP Event team were instrumental in creating our dream wedding. Working with Team RAP in the year leading up to the wedding 
            was wonderful. They are incredibly experienced and knowledgable, while also being relatable and fun. Riha, Abhisheka and Priyanka were on top of everything from the moment we 
            first met. We were all able to relax and be present on the wedding day, everything was taken care of and expertly handled by the professionals. My 
            husband and I really wanted our wedding to represent us as individuals, this is where RAP Event Planning really excels, they do more than just 
            create a beautiful party (although they do that exceedingly well), they incorporate the things you love and value into the perfect wedding. Riha, Abhishek and Priyanka worked 
            relentlessly to make our crazy ideas come to life in a realistic and budget conscious way. The attention to detail and commitment to clients truly sets 
            RAP Event Planning apart.”</p>

        <p class="para">Team RAP and the entire RAP Events team had to be one of the best decisions we made during wedding planning and I’m so happy we had them on 
            board for the month of coordination! I had a relatively small wedding in Canacona and assumed early on that I could figure out most of the details 
            myself. I quickly realized that nothing compares to having experts like them who know how to handle any last minute issue and have wealth of experience 
            working with vendors/venues across Goa. Team RAP had great recommendations for vendors I neglected to look into earlier on in the process and was a huge 
            help in making sure critical details, such as the rain plan, were worked out.
            <br>
            Where the team really excels is making sure you do not deal with any stress on the day of the wedding and focus on having fun. I was so impressed with 
            how professional, patient, kind and calming the entire team was. They made sure the bridal parties all were on schedule, vendor setups were done on time, 
            food was set aside for my husband and I during cocktail hour, swapped out my heels when they saw I was in pain and even ran back to the house when we forgot 
            our marriage license. These are just some of the little details the team took care of so we didn’t have to worry about anything. They truly are your eyes 
            and ears and it was such a relief knowing they got it handled. They truly love their jobs and their passion for what they do shines.
            <br>
            Please do yourself a favor and hire RAP Events! I’m recommending them to all my friends for their weddings and events.”</p>

        <p class="para">“If you have ANY doubt about what RAP Event Planners can bring to your wedding, let me tell you that beyond a shadow of a doubt, my family could 
            FULLY enjoy my daughter’s wedding because of Riha, Abhishek and Priyanka and their team. They are the loveliest of people, took care of EVERY behind-the-scene detail, 
            and made it appear that it was the smoothest and most relaxed day in wedding history. It certainly was for us. Boston is very lucky to have them and 
            if/when we have another family wedding, I’ll be standing at their front door.”</p>
